The purpose of this project is to share knowledge on how Awesome Streamlit is and can become. Pull requests are very welcome!
A faster way to build and share data apps.

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. 
It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our Community Cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share your app.
